A website is the face of your real estate business. It's where people go to get information about you and your services, and if it looks good and works well, they'll return again and again. Many companies want their website to serve as a virtual office that can help them answer questions, book appointments, or even show properties.

## Generating leads via a real estate website

With your site, you can include all sorts of content related to your business and specific properties. Like any other online marketing strategy, you should focus on building quality backlinks and engaging users with great content.

The first step is to geotarget your website so that it will show up whenever people search for real estate agents in a specific area. Then, you'll want to focus on driving traffic and generating leads:

1) Make sure to include plenty of local keywords and phrases throughout your site.

2) Offer quality content that is not only helpful but also optimized for search listed in local directories such as Google My Business and Yelp.

3) As people visit your site, keep them engaged with social media and e-mail newsletters.

4) Focus on building quality backlinks to your website in order to get more traffic over time.

5) Use Google Analytics to track the results of your efforts using real estate website templates. You'll be able to see how many visitors your site gets and which pages receive the most traffic. Use that information to improve your website's performance.

When you work with a team that understands SEO and web development, they'll take care of all these steps for you so that you don't have to worry about SEO or getting lost in Google search results.
