With so many different options available for an e-commerce website, it's hard to choose how to move forward with your online business. Deciding on the costs, tools, and features that your business may need in the future is an important decision. Shopify remains to be the biggest e-commerce platform, providing the necessary tools for sellers with the easiest user interface to navigate. Our e-commerce clients at Hungry Ram love Shopify and its ease of use.

## Why Shopify Is Our Preferred Choice

As website designers, we've used various tools for website building to accomplish our client's vision for their online store. From using custom development tools like Snipcart and WordPress plugins like Woocommerce, we always found building websites on Shopify more enjoyable, especially with their 2.0 online store.

### Trusted Themes and Plugins

Having an online business means your website needs to scale with tools and additional features. What we love are the apps that could be used to add features Shopify may not offer right out the box. These apps range from free to paid apps that are trusted by Shopify developers. An issue we had with WordPress was the third-party plugins that were not monitored as close, and potentially breaking your website when it was time for updating. One of the main reasons why we no longer support WordPress.

Some clients may be on a budget when it comes to owning a website, and a custom e-commerce store can become expensive. Shopify offers several free themes to easily begin selling. Need a more advanced theme? A premium theme may range from only a few hundred dollars. A great investment to kickstart your Shopify store.

### Shopify Offers Code Editing

As developers, our team at Hungry Ram loves handling code-related projects. Shopify offers a code editor that allows us to modify existing code. Giving us the ability to add new sections and features to the website.

Getting easy access to code means we have more control over the design and features that an online store may need.

### Secure Payments and Hosting

Shopify is a hosted online store with the needed security for handling payment processing. Meaning any Shopify customers never have to handle the maintenance on servers and collect any sensitive information. This was a big yes for us on deciding the best e-commerce platform for our client's online stores. 

Shopify's basic plan starts at $29/mo and we couldn't be happier with the price point. No need to worry about the headaches of server maintenance and software updates! (looking at you WordPress).
