## We integrate with the best IDX solution available, so you can provide your clients with the latest web technology.

Your MLS website is a great tool for attracting new clients, but it's not as effective as you'd like.

Our real estate agent IDX website will help you increase your lead generation by providing visitors with lead capture tools on top of the newest website technology. You'll be able to view a report on the number of people who save listings, search results, and are contacted when new listings come on the market.

By adding IHomefinder to your website you'll be able to collect contact information from viewers at every step of their home buying journey! This means better leads for you and an easier time selling homes in today's competitive real estate market.

## Powerful, and affordable real estate websites

At Hungry Ram, we understand that real estate is a very competitive industry and you need to stand out from the competition.

Most real estate website templates are expensive, hard to customize, or lack essential features like lead capture tools and proper MLS integration. This makes it difficult for real estate agents to attract clients and get more leads. 

Hungry Ram delivers a new type of real estate website that's affordable, effective, and different from most sites being built. With our carefully crafted template, you can take advantage of admin tools to personalize it to your brand. Don't worry, we'll put everything together for you before delivering your site so you don't need any web design experience at all!

Our clients love how our admin can be customized to fit their business needs with the help of our support team. We will even provide training for free if needed! You get what you need without paying extra or hiring an expensive developer which means more money in your pocket.
